# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 9: Tuesday 23rd January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Finished Chapter 4 and 5 in the Eloquent JavaScript Book.

**Thoughts:** Got focused and into a good flow today so I picked up on some of the difficult topics quickly. Feels extremely satisfying making so much progress. As I didn't have the laptop with me today, I couldn't play with the examples in the book. Thinking about starting the Pomodoro Clock project after I get through Part 1 of the book which is 11 chapters so I can use the knowledge I have learnt from the book for this project.

### Day 8: Saturday 21st January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Went to the FreeCodeCamp Meetup for the first time in 3 months, worked with a few devs, and made some new friends. Solved a Flexbox alignment and responsive problem with one dev at the meetup.

**Thoughts:** After speaking to developers in their first front end developer jobs, they told me I was more than ready to start applying for jobs and many self taught developers suffer from imposter syndrome. This has given me great confidence to start applying sooner rather than later.

### Day 7: Friday 20th January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Completed Chapter 3 and half of 4 in the Eloquent JavaScript book.

**Thoughts:** This book is taking longer than I thought to get through. My progress has slowed gradually since I started with this challenge which I'm a little disappointed with. I would like to pick up the pace and get through my work a little quicker. Haven't been focused as well as I should be.

### Day 6: Wednesday 18th January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Started working on the Eloquent JavaScript Book. Got through the first chapter. Also solved one challenge from the Advanced Algorithm Section.

**Thoughts:** Missed out on a week of coding. Don't feel good about it but there wasn't much I could do about it unfortunately. Back again now and hopefully can go on a long streak without any breaks.

### Day 5: Wednesday 11th January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Fixed bugs in my code and made some design changes.

**Thoughts:** Couldn't push myself to work enough today because of a flu which didn't let me sleep enough last night. Don't feel good for not making the most out of all the time I had. Hoping this flu passes quickly so I can get back to working hard.

### Day 4: Tuesday 10th January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Cleaned up my code by making functions for duplicate code. Renamed css classes and variables to names easier to understand. Made comments to the code to describe what each step/function is doing.

**Thoughts:** Didn't get much work done today because I am sick but did grind at least an hour.

### Day 3: Monday 9th January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Finished the JavaScript Calculator Project on FCC to the User Stories requirements.

**Thoughts:** Very happy completing the project in only 3 days. Improvements can be made to the calculator but not required. The code feels a little messy so will clean up. I would like to use ES6, Closures, Prototype Inheritance etc to practice using these for the first time but cannot see how so will work on these individually first and come back to the project and apply what I have learnt if possible in this project.

### Day 2: Friday 6th January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Finished HTML & CSS. Completed most of JavaScript. Spent time figuring out what exactly each button should do and how to code that appropriately.

**Thoughts:** Surprised myself that I was nearly able to complete a difficult project in two days. I'm much better than I thought I was. It's really exciting to see so many people doing this challenge and helping other people on Gitter and striking up conversations.

### Day 1: Thursday 5th January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Started Javascript Calculator Project. Completed most of HTML & CSS. Planned user stories, design, and a bit of JS.

**Thoughts:** Had no idea where and how to start this morning so planned on paper which got me coding. Feeling confident and happy now.
