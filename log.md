# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: Friday 6th January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Finished HTML & CSS. Completed most of JavaScript. Spent time figuring out what exactly each button should do and how to code that appropriately.

**Thoughts:** Surprised myself that I was nearly able to complete a difficult project in two days. I'm much better than I thought I was. It's really exciting to see so many people doing this challenge and helping other people on Gitter and striking up conversations.

### Day 1: Thursday 5th January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Started Javascript Calculator Project. Completed most of HTML & CSS. Planned user stories, design, and a bit of JS.

**Thoughts:** Had no idea where and how to start this morning so planned on paper which got me coding. Feeling confident and happy now.
