# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: Monday 9th January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Finished the JavaScript Calculator Project on FCC to the User Stories requirements.

**Thoughts:** Very happy completing the project in only 3 days. Improvements can be made to the calculator but not required. The code feels a little messy so will clean up. I would like to use ES6, Closures, Prototype Inheritance etc to practice using these for the first time but cannot see how so will work on these individually first and come back to the project and apply what I have learnt if possible in this project.

### Day 2: Friday 6th January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Finished HTML & CSS. Completed most of JavaScript. Spent time figuring out what exactly each button should do and how to code that appropriately.

**Thoughts:** Surprised myself that I was nearly able to complete a difficult project in two days. I'm much better than I thought I was. It's really exciting to see so many people doing this challenge and helping other people on Gitter and striking up conversations.

### Day 1: Thursday 5th January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Started Javascript Calculator Project. Completed most of HTML & CSS. Planned user stories, design, and a bit of JS.

**Thoughts:** Had no idea where and how to start this morning so planned on paper which got me coding. Feeling confident and happy now.
