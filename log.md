# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday 5th January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Started Javascript Calculator Project. Completed most of HTML & CSS. Planned user stories, design, and a bit of JS.

**Thoughts:** Had no idea where and how to start this morning so planned on paper which got me coding. Feeling confident and happy now.
